# Disc-Restock-Bot
This bot was designed to alert clients through text messages about when specific disc models were restocked online. It periodically scraped websites using the Twilio API and the Timer/TimerTask abstract classes. Due to legality concerns, the process of turning this into a website via Spring Boot has stopped, but the backend code remains.
