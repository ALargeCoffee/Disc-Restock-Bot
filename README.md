# Disc-Restock-Bot
This project was an application designed to notify clients when a disc golf vendor restocked certain disc models via phone. It utilized the Twilio API and the Timer/TimerTask abstract classes to scrape websites periodically. Due to legality concerns, the process of turning this into a website via Spring Boot has stopped, but the backend code remains.
